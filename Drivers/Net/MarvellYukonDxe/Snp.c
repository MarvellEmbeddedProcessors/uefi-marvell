/**
  Reads the current interrupt status and recycled transmit buffer status from a
  network interface.

  This function gets the current interrupt and recycled transmit buffer status
  from the network interface. The interrupt status is returned as a bit mask in
  InterruptStatus. If InterruptStatus is NULL, the interrupt status will not be
  read. If TxBuf is not NULL, a recycled transmit buffer address will be retrieved.
  If a recycled transmit buffer address is returned in TxBuf, then the buffer has
  been successfully transmitted, and the status for that buffer is cleared. If
  the status of the network interface is successfully collected, EFI_SUCCESS
  will be returned. If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will
  be returned.

   <at> param This                    A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
   <at> param InterruptStatus         A pointer to the bit mask of the currently active
                                      interrupts (see "Related Definitions"). If this is NULL,
                                      the interrupt status will not be read from the device.
                                      If this is not NULL, the interrupt status will be read
                                      from the device. When the interrupt status is read, it
                                      will also be cleared. Clearing the transmit interrupt does
                                      not empty the recycled transmit buffer array.
   <at> param TxBuf                   Recycled transmit buffer address. The network interface

                                      buffer array is full. Reading the transmit buffer does
                                      not clear the transmit interrupt. If this is NULL, then
                                      the transmit buffer status will not be read. If there
                                      are no transmit buffers to recycle and TxBuf is not NULL,

  Performs read and write operations on the NVRAM device attached to a network
  interface.

  This function performs read and write operations on the NVRAM device attached
  to a network interface. If ReadWrite is TRUE, a read operation is performed.
  If ReadWrite is FALSE, a write operation is performed. Offset specifies the
  byte offset at which to start either operation. Offset must be a multiple of
  NvRamAccessSize , and it must have a value between zero and NvRamSize.
  BufferSize specifies the length of the read or write operation. BufferSize must
  also be a multiple of NvRamAccessSize, and Offset + BufferSize must not exceed
  NvRamSize.
  If any of the above conditions is not met, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be
  returned.
  If all the conditions are met and the operation is "read," the NVRAM device
  attached to the network interface will be read into Buffer and EFI_SUCCESS
  will be returned. If this is a write operation, the contents of Buffer will be
  used to update the contents of the NVRAM device attached to the network

/**
  Manages the multicast receive filters of a network interface.

  This function is used enable and disable the hardware and software receive
  filters for the underlying network device.
  The receive filter change is broken down into three steps:
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Enable parameter are added to
    the current receive filter settings.
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Disable parameter are subtracted
    from the updated receive filter settings.
  * If the resulting receive filter setting is not supported by the hardware a
    more liberal setting is selected.
  If the same bits are set in the Enable and Disable parameters, then the bits
  in the Disable parameter takes precedence.
  If the ResetMCastFilter parameter is TRUE, then the multicast address list
  filter is disabled (irregardless of what other multicast bits are set in the
  Enable and Disable parameters). The SNP->Mode->MCastFilterCount field is set
  to zero. The Snp->Mode->MCastFilter contents are undefined.
  After enabling or disabling receive filter settings, software should verify
  the new settings by checking the Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings,
  Snp->Mode->MCastFilterCount and Snp->Mode->MCastFilter fields.
  Note: Some network drivers and/or devices will automatically promote receive
    filter settings if the requested setting can not be honored. For example, if
    a request for four multicast addresses is made and the underlying hardware
    only supports two multicast addresses the driver might set the promiscuous
    or promiscuous multicast receive filters instead. The receiving software is
    responsible for discarding any extra packets that get through the hardware
    receive filters.
    Note: Note: To disable all receive filter hardware, the network driver must
      be Shutdown() and Stopped(). Calling ReceiveFilters() with Disable set to
      Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings will make it so no more packets are
      returned by the Receive() function, but the receive hardware may still be
      moving packets into system memory before inspecting and discarding them.
      Unexpected system errors, reboots and hangs can occur if an OS is loaded
      and the network devices are not Shutdown() and Stopped().
  If ResetMCastFilter is TRUE, then the multicast receive filter list on the
  network interface will be reset to the default multicast receive filter list.
  If ResetMCastFilter is FALSE, and this network interface allows the multicast
  receive filter list to be modified, then the MCastFilterCnt and MCastFilter
  are used to update the current multicast receive filter list. The modified
  receive filter list settings can be found in the MCastFilter field of
  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE. If the network interface does not allow the multicast
  receive filter list to be modified, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.
  If the receive filter mask and multicast receive filter list have been
  successfully updated on the network interface, EFI_SUCCESS will be returned.

/**
  Places a packet in the transmit queue of a network interface.

  This function places the packet specified by Header and Buffer on the transmit
  queue. If HeaderSize is nonzero and HeaderSize is not equal to
  This->SnpMode->MediaHeaderSize, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned. If
  BufferSize is less than This->SnpMode->MediaHeaderSize, then EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
  will be returned. If Buffer is NULL, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be
  returned. If HeaderSize is nonzero and DestAddr or Protocol is NULL, then
  EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned. If the transmit engine of the network
  interface is busy, then EFI_NOT_READY will be returned. If this packet can be
  accepted by the transmit engine of the network interface, the packet contents
  specified by Buffer will be placed on the transmit queue of the network
  interface, and EFI_SUCCESS will be returned. GetStatus() can be used to
  determine when the packet has actually been transmitted. The contents of the
  Buffer must not be modified until the packet has actually been transmitted.
  The Transmit() function performs nonblocking I/O. A caller who wants to perform
  blocking I/O, should call Transmit(), and then GetStatus() until the
  transmitted buffer shows up in the recycled transmit buffer.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.
