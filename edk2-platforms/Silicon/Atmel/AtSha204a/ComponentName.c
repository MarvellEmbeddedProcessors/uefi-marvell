/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of a driver in the form of a
  Unicode string. If the driver specified by This has a user readable name in
  the language specified by Language, then a pointer to the driver name is
  returned in DriverName, and EFI_SUCCESS is returned. If the driver specified
  by This does not support the language specified by Language,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

  @param  This[in]              A pointer to the EFI_COMPONENT_NAME2_PROTOCOL or
                                EFI_COMPONENT_NAME_PROTOCOL instance.

                                requesting, and it must match one of the
                                languages specified in SupportedLanguages. The
                                number of languages supported by a driver is up

/**
  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
  that is being managed by a driver.

  This function retrieves the user readable name of the controller specified by
  ControllerHandle and ChildHandle in the form of a Unicode string. If the
  driver specified by This has a user readable name in the language specified by
  Language, then a pointer to the controller name is returned in ControllerName,
  and EFI_SUCCESS is returned.  If the driver specified by This is not currently
  managing the controller specified by ControllerHandle and ChildHandle,
  then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.  If the driver specified by This does not
  support the language specified by Language, then EFI_UNSUPPORTED is returned.

  @param  ControllerHandle[in]  The handle of a controller that the driver
                                specified by This is managing.  This handle
                                specifies the controller whose name is to be
