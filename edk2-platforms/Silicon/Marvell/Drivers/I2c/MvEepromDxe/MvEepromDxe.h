 * FIXME: This flag is also defined in Drivers/I2c/MvI2cDxe/MvI2cDxe.h
 * and it's important to have both version synced. This solution is
 * temporary and shared flag should be used by both files.
 * Situation is analogous with I2C_GUID, which also should be common, but is
 * for now defined same way in two header files.
