1. Porting I2C driver to a new SOC
----------------------------------
In order to enable driver on a new platform, following steps need to be taken:
 - add following line to .dsc file:
   OpenPlatformPkg/Drivers/I2c/MvI2cDxe/MvI2cDxe.inf
 - add following line to .fdf file:
   INF OpenPlatformPkg/Drivers/I2c/MvI2cDxe/MvI2cDxe.inf
 - add PCDs with relevant values to .dsc file:
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cSlaveAddresses|{ 0x50, 0x57 }
   (addresses of I2C slave devices on bus)
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cSlaveBuses|{ 0x0, 0x0 }
   (buses to which accoring slaves are attached)
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cBusCount|2
   (number of SoC's I2C buses)
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cBaseAddresses|L"0xF2701000;0xF2701100"
   (base addresses of I2C controller buses)
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cClockFrequency|200000000
   (I2C host controller clock frequency)
     gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdI2cBaudRate|100000
   (baud rate used in I2C transmission)
