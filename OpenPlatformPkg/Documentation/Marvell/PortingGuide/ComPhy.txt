COMPHY configuration
---------------------------
In order to configure ComPhy library, following PCDs are available:

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdComPhyDevices

This array indicates, which ones of the ComPhy chips defined in
MVHW_COMPHY_DESC template will be configured.

Every ComPhy PCD has <Num> part where <Num> stands for chip ID (order is not
important, but configuration will be set for first PcdComPhyChipCount chips).

Every chip has 3 ComPhy PCDs and three of them comprise per-board lanes
settings for this chip. Their format is unicode string, containing settings
for up to 10 lanes. Setting for each one is separated with semicolon.
These PCDs together describe outputs of PHY integrated in simple cihp.
Below is example for the first chip (Chip0).

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdChip0ComPhyTypes

Unicode string indicating PHY types. Currently supported are:

{ L"unconnected", L"PCIE0", L"PCIE1", L"PCIE2", L"PCIE3",
L"SATA0", L"SATA1", L"SATA2", L"SATA3", L"SGMII0",
L"SGMII1", L"SGMII2", L"SGMII3",
L"USB3_HOST0", L"USB3_HOST1", L"USB3_DEVICE",
L"RXAUI0", L"RXAUI1", L"SFI" }

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdChip0ComPhySpeeds

Indicates PHY speeds in MHz. Currently supported are:

{ 1250, 1500, 2500, 3000, 3125, 5000, 6000, 6250, 10310 }

  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdChip0ComPhyInvFlags

Indicates lane polarity invert.

Example
-------
  #ComPhy
  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdComPhyDevices|{ 0x1 }
  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdChip0ComPhyTypes|L"SGMII1;USB3_HOST0;SFI;SATA1;USB3_HOST1;PCIE2"
  gMarvellTokenSpaceGuid.PcdChip0ComPhySpeeds|L"1250;5000;10310;5000;5000;5000"
