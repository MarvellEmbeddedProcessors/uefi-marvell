This pseudo-random implementation of RngLib is unsafe, and is not intended for
use in production. It is provided for development purposes only, and only to be
used on development platforms that lack any hardware peripherals to implement
RngLib properly.

Note that this code blindly assumes the availability of the AES instructions,
and the accessibility of the cycle counter. If either is not available, this
code will crash.
